#  Localization Principles

## Keys

- Keys are used in code rather than English strings. 
- All localized strings must have a comment to explain their purpose.

## Key Formats

- For strings that are static and have no associated action: `label.text.string-summary`.
- For strings that are have an action associated: `action.text.string-summary`. 
- For help text that differs from the the label or the action: `help.text.string-summary`.
